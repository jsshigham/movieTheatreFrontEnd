- Developed as an example of what a movie theater might use to update the movies that they are showing and when they are playing with CRUD functionality.
- This is the Front-end and is a Vite React app, with the design being created through TailwindCSS. Users can select movies to edit or delete and have the option to create new movies too. The front-end automatically displays movies on the home page.
